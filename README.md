### Hi you beautiful people! 👋

I'm a fullstack JavaScript developer with a passion for frontend. Recently I played around with Jamstack and now I have multiple side project going at once. I hope I can "finish" one before I get another *great* idea. 🙂 I also am in the process of learning Swift and getting my second app in the App Store.

I love mountainbiking 🚵‍♀️ more than anything in the world. If I could I would do nothing but riding my bike and code interesting apps and websites from now and then. 🤩
